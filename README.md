# PagerDuty University API Workshop Utility

This is a utility that populates a PagerDuty account with some test data for the [PagerDuty University](https://www.pagerduty.com/university/) API Workshop. The code for this project showcases [PKCE OAuth](https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/oauth-2-functionality-pkce) as well as the [teams](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/reference/REST/openapiv3.json/paths/~1teams/get) endpoint of the PagerDuty API using the [pdjs](https://github.com/PagerDuty/pdjs) library.

## How to use
